# Classification

***

Using the NExpress catalog to find items shelved as member libraries requires that items follow basic classification rules.  The NExpress rules are based on the item's home library, shelving location, item type, collection code, and call number in that order.

A visual overview of how items are classified would look something like this:

## Home library:

Each item has a home library that is defined by the drop-down list of current NExpress libraries.  Each library has a library code and a library name.  Patrons will only ever see a library's name in the OPAC.  Staff will usually see library names but may see library codes - especially when running reports.  The current library codes/names are:
