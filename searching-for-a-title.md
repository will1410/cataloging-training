C. If you find results, verify that the items actually match by verifying the ISBN in the 020$a, or the UPC number in the 024$a but also verify that the title, author, year, publisher, physical description \(page numbers, large print, etc.\) match.

D. If you have a match, you can just add the item you're cataloging to the existing record.

E. If you do not find a match on the ISBN or UPC number, you should then do a search by title/author. It is possible that a copy exists that matches in every way except ISBN or UPC number. This can especially be true for items that are quite old or have been self-published.

F. If you find a match based on title/author, you should also verify that the year, publisher, physical description \(page numbers, large print, etc.\) match.
