D. If you find a match, click on the "MARC" or the "Card" link to pre-view the record and make sure that the record is a good match.  Generally speaking, the more data you see on the "Card" link, the better the record.

G. After the bibliographic record has been saved, you will be redirected to the add items page so you can add your items to the new record.

H. If you don't find any items via a Z39.50 it is not a bad idea to repeat the search a couple of different ways.

I. If no search returns a result, you should move on to adding a title through ShareIt.
