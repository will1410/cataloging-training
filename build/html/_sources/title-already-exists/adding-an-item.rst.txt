D. If you only have one item to add to the record, once the fields are
filled, click on "Add item" to finish adding the item.

Adding 2 items to one records
-----------------------------

E. If you have two copies of the same title to add to a record, once
you've finished adding the first, click "Add and duplicate" to add a
second copy and follow the instructions below.

The fields on the second item will match the details you updated on the
first item except the barcode number.

Adding more than 2 items to one records
---------------------------------------

F. If you have more than 2 copies of the same title to add to a record
and your barcode numbers are in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4 . . .), once you've
finished adding the first, click "Add multiple copies of this item."

A new field will open that will allow you to enter the total number of
items that you're going to add to this record.

All of the items you add using this method will have barcode nubers
added in sequence starting with the first number you enter. For example,
if you are adding 5 copies and the first has barcode number 1006, the
items will have barcode numbers 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, and 1010.
