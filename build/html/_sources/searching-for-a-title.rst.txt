C. If you find results, verify that the items actually match by
verifying the ISBN in the
020\ :math:`a, or the UPC number in the 024`\ a but also verify that the
title, author, year, publisher, physical description (page numbers,
large print, etc.) match.

D. If you have a match, you can just add the item you're cataloging to
the existing record.

E. If you do not find a match on the ISBN or UPC number, you should then
do a search by title/author. It is possible that a copy exists that
matches in every way except ISBN or UPC number. This can especially be
true for items that are quite old or have been self-published.

F. If you find a match based on title/author, you should also verify
that the year, publisher, physical description (page numbers, large
print, etc.) match.
