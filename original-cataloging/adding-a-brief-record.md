# Adding a brief record

If you can’t find a record already in NExpress, or a record via Z39.50 or a record in Shareit, you may need to create an original catalog record.

Go to Cataloging \(More--&gt;Cataloging\), and choose New Record --&gt; Brief Records Framework.

Fill in the following fields accordingly, if applicable:

* 000 -- Leader - click in this field and let it autofill
* 008 -- Fixed length data elements - click in this field and let it autofill
* 020 -- ISBN 024 -- UPC code \(if applicable -- found on Music, DVDs, CDs\)
* 100 -- Author \(if applicable\)
* 245 -- Title \(required\)
* 250 -- edition \(if applicable\)
* 264 -- Publication information
  * a - place
  * b - publisher
  * c - year \(most important piece of information here\)
* 300 -- physical description. Please at least record the number of pages, number of discs.
* 490 -- series statement \(if applicable\)
  * a - series name
  * v - volume number
* 500 – add note if applicable

Save the record, and add your item information accordingly.
