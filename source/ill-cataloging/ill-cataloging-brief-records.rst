ILL cataloging brief records
============================

Cataloging ILLs into Koha, Best Practices

1. Go to ​Cataloging​ (​More​→​Cataloging​)
2. Click on the button, ​New record​ ​→​ ​Fast Add for ILL and Temporary
   Circulation​. The form for ​Add MARC​ record appears.
3. Click in the ​000​ and ​008​ fields and let them auto-fill
4. In the ​245a​ (Title) field, type in caps, “LIBRARY NAME ILL” Title
   of material.
5. Click ​Save​.
6. The ​Add item​ form appears. Fill in the following: a. 8-Koha
   collection​: ILL (by using this collection code, it remains hidden in
   the OPAC) b. c-Shelving location​ (if appropriate) c. p-Barcode​ (can
   be what’s on the material/a temporary one of your choosing) d.
   ​y-Koha item type​: already auto-set to Borrowed from another library
7. Click ​Add item​ to save the information

Other ILL processes 8. Place a hold for the library patron getting the
item, and trigger the hold for pick up.

1. Place a second hold for a staff account, so when the item is returned
   and possibly checked into Koha, the staff member checking it in,
   knows to give it to the ILL person to check in on that system and
   delete the info from Koha.
2. When the ILL item is returned, delete the item in Koha. No need to
   delete the bib record, unless you want to – a script deletes empty
   records each week.
