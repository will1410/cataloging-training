Adding a title by Z39.50
========================

A. First search for a title using the `"Searching for a
title" <../searching-for-a-title.md>`__ instructions.

`Click here for the "Searching for a title"
instructions <../searching-for-a-title.md>`__

B. If a title cannot be found, go to "Cataloging" and click on the "New
from Z39.50/SRU" button.

author - or a combination of any of these (to search by UPC, scan the
UPC code into the ISBN field) - then click on the "Search" button.

D. If you find a match, click on the "MARC" or the "Card" link to
pre-view the record and make sure that the record is a good match.
Generally speaking, the more data you see on the "Card" link, the better
the record.

H. If you don't find any items via a Z39.50 it is not a bad idea to
repeat the search a couple of different ways.

You can re-do the search using different data.

I. If no search returns a result, you should move on to `adding a title
through ShareIt. <adding-a-title-from-shareit.md>`__
